# Python_basics
1. Fizzbuzz algorithm 
#Write a function called fizz_buzz that takes a number.

    If the number is divisible by 3, it should return “Fizz”.
    If it is divisible by 5, it should return “Buzz”.
    If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should return “FizzBuzz”.
    Otherwise, it should return the same number.
    
2. Write a function that returns the maximum of two numbers.

3. Write a function called showNumbers that takes a parameter called limit.
It should print all the numbers between 0 and limit with a label to identify the even and odd numbers. 
For example, if the limit is 3, it should print:

    0 EVEN
    1 ODD
    2 EVEN
    3 ODD
